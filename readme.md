## Build

Do `npm i` and then `npm t`, which checks and builds the site.
This basic build uses two shortcuts over the full build:

*   Images are not optimised
*   Data is not crawled

The full build is a slow site to properly build!
Takes about 20 minutes (ðŸ¤¯) on my tiny trusted 12 inch MacBook.
The reason for this is that it crawls the whole ecosystem.
We contact 5 APIâ€™s: GitHub, npm, npms, OpenCollective, and BundlePhobia.
When generating, it builds a performant static site.
Everything is minified.
Images are highly optimised.

To fully build the site, create a `.env` file with the following tokens:

```ini
GH_TOKEN=123123123
NPM_TOKEN=456456456
OC_TOKEN=789789789
```

Then, `npm install` and `UNIFIED_OPTIMIZE_IMAGES=1 npm test` should do the
trick!

```sh
npm i && UNIFIED_OPTIMIZE_IMAGES=1 npm t
```
